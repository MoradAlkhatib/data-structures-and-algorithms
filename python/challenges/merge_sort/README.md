# Challenge Summary
Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code.
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language.
Present a complete set of working tests.

## Whiteboard Process
![merge_sort](margesort.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(nlogn)
Because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.
Space: O(1)
This list is being sorted in place, keeping the space at constant O(1).

## Solution
sort array my use marge algorithm
