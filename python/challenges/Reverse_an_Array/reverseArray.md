# Reverse an Array
 Made a function called reverseArray that tack an array and return revers for this array 
    without use any build in function 
  example:- 
  Input [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
  Output [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

## Approach & Efficiency
I solved this problem by using for loop to iterated on the items inside the arr and make an mirror
to switch the firs item with last item and so on and stopped on the middle after it the  return the array 
that was reversed all item 

Efficiency
time :O(n) the time is related of how much items inside array of n 
space:O(1) that because i didn't use declare any list or dictionary and I think that the best way and have a 
little bit of space
